The 5 Cs of Credit—Character, Capacity, Capital, Collateral, and Conditions—represent the fundamental data architecture required for robust credit risk assessment and modern predictive modeling. In the realm of Machine Learning (ML), these pillars serve as the primary framework for feature engineering; they allow algorithms to move beyond linear scoring by identifying complex, non-linear correlations between a borrower’s historical reliability (Character) and their real-time financial agility (Capacity). When integrated into ML analytics, the 5 Cs enable the calculation of critical metrics like Probability of Default (PD) and Loss Given Default (LGD) with high precision, using alternative data to fill traditional gaps. Furthermore, these categories are essential for data visualization, where they are transformed into risk heatmaps, radar charts, and stress-test dashboards. This visual synthesis allows lenders to identify portfolio vulnerabilities at a glance, ensuring that predictive insights are not just statistically significant, but also intuitively actionable for strategic decision-making and regulatory compliance.

High Level Data Description : 
This dataset is a synthetic loan portfolio focused on modeling the likelihood of loan default at the individual borrower level.​

Structure and target The file is a flat CSV where each row represents a unique loan, identified by LoanID, with a binary target variable Default (0 = no default, 1 = default). The predictors mix numerical and categorical features describing borrower demographics, credit profile, and loan contract terms.​

Key numerical variables Core continuous fields include borrower Age, Income, LoanAmount, CreditScore, MonthsEmployed, NumCreditLines, InterestRate, LoanTerm, and DTIRatio (debt-to-income ratio). These cover affordability, leverage, credit experience, and price of credit, which are typical drivers in credit risk modeling.​

Key categorical variables Several categorical columns capture socioeconomic and relationship information: Education (e.g., High School, Bachelor's, Master's, PhD), EmploymentType (Full-time, Part-time, Self-employed, Unemployed), and MaritalStatus. Additional binary flags describe household and loan context: HasMortgage, HasDependents, LoanPurpose (Home, Auto, Business, Education, Other), and HasCoSigner.

Quick Summary :

This project builds an end-to-end credit risk assessment framework that combines rich exploratory visualizations with a full machine learning pipeline for default prediction. It starts by loading a retail loan dataset and creating professional, business-oriented figures: categorical default breakdowns, correlation and risk-segmentation views, and an Expected Credit Loss (PD–LGD–EAD) analysis, plus approval-rate and profitability curves across decision thresholds. On the modeling side, it engineers risk-focused features, handles class imbalance (e.g., with SMOTE), and trains a suite of models (from logistic regression to advanced gradient-boosting and ensemble methods), then compares them using consistent metrics and validation. Finally, it links model probabilities to business decisions through threshold optimization and cost–benefit analysis, so that risk, return, and approval policies can be quantitatively aligned.
